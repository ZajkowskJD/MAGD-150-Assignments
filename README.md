# James Zajkowski's MAGD Projects

I have compiled all of my compressed project folders into one super folder to keep track of things.

Find my compressed projects [here.](https://github.com/ZajkowskJD/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/MAGD%20work)

- **Lab_01:** _Introduction to P5.js and Static Composition in Black and White_, a drawing from simple 2D shapes in black in white of a somewhat shogunate-style building. I'm not the best artist, so it doesn't look like much. 

- **Lab_02:** _Static Composition in Color_, Another simple 2D shapes drawing, this time with color. Tried doing a red giant with an outer ring, unfortunately it didn't turn out too well. Feel free to heckle it in all of its scuffed glory.

- **Lab_03:** _Math Operations and Variables_, If you thought the last one was bad, this one looks even worse. It's literally just a grayscale circle that gradually expands and contracts for all eternity. If you click the tinier black circle in the center, it prints the current radius of the 'moving' circle to the console. Not my finest moment.

- **Lab_04:** _Dynamism_, Another of the 'proof of concept' style of programs, but at least this one is a bit more interesting. It's got a little pizza box moving around the screen like a DVD screensaver and some controls that allow you to mess with its movement. depending on what mode is active, you can speed it up, slow it down, or make it change directions.

- **Lab_05:** _Intersections_, This time the theme was movies, so I knew I just had to keep the old code from the previous project. This time it's an actual DVD screensaver and instead of just mouse and keyboard controlling the movement it uses onscreen buttons that are clickable.

- **Lab_06:** _Transformations and Function_, Aaaand we're back to awful almost-drawings. I remember I had particular trouble with this one, mainly because it was my first time using push-pop instances and I was hazy on the details. Somehow, what's there on the screen was the best I could manage, but it did meet all the assignment requirements. I think.

- **Lab_07:** _Objects and Arrays_, By now you're likely seeing a pattern in my artistic capabilities, but at least this one is a bit less of an eyesore. The program draws three trees on a snowy background in a somewhat random location every time the program is called. The idea is that the trees were drawn by a function that was called multiple times.

- **Lab_08:** _Images and Type_, the task was to create something similar to a movie poster with small amounts of animation. I used Initial D as the inspiration, first thing that had come to me off the top of my head at the time. You'll also notice this is the best looking piece of code I've slapped together, likely because it isn't me doing the drawing.

- **Lab_09:** _Sound and Video_, Now this one, I am proud of. I made a super-reverby version of Caramelldanses at 0.5x speed and gave it some appropriate looking video to accompany it. I mean it when I say, 'prepare to meet God', this could legit be something to meditate to if looped for several hours.

- **Lab_10:** _3D, Data and HTML_, At least I'm decent at abstract art. the point of this exercise was to load in and draw 3D objects, along with data from a JSON file. I didn't know where to find JSON data, so I ended up using the one provided in the example. Combine the nonsense information with RGB versions of the blender monkey head and a strangely rotating cone, and it really makes you wonder what the hell you just booted up. Still better than most of my other projects.
